The ClinTox dataset, introduced as part of this work, compares drugs approved by the FDA and drugs that have failed clinical trials for toxicity reasons. The dataset includes two classification tasks for 1491 drug compounds with known chemical structures: (1) clinical trial toxicity (or absence of toxicity) and (2) FDA approval status. List of FDA-approved drugs are compiled from the SWEETLEAD database, and list of drugs that failed clinical trials for toxicity reasons are compiled from the Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov (AACT) database.
