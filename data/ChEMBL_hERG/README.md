Extracted from ChEMBL database. We retrieved IC50 data related to hERG inhibition from a total number of 9887 molecules from binding assays and functional assays present the online ChEMBL data base. To create a binary classification problem, we used a threshold value of IC50 = 10 000 nM to split the data set into a set of non-inhibitory compounds of size 4874 and a set of active inhibitors of size 5013.
