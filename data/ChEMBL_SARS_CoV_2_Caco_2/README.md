The data set, which was published recently by Ellinger et al., consists of a large drug-repurposing study in which 5632 compounds were experimentally screened for inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2. The assay represents a type of phenotypic screening for drug-like molecules which inhibit cellular toxicity induced by Sars-Cov-2 virus in Caco-2 cells. For each compound, inhibitory potential was determined by measuring the inhibition of SARS-Cov-2 induced cytotoxicity of Caco-2 cells 48 hours after infection at 10μmol compound concentration. This results in a percentage value pc for each compound c in the data set. The value pc is normalized with respect to the two baselines 0% (:“ same cellular toxicity as with virus and no added compound) and 100% (:“ same cellular toxicity
as with no virus and no added inhibitor). Thus, one can interpret pc as the percentage to which the compound c prevents predicted SARS-CoV-2 induced cellular toxicity in human Caco-2 cells. The higher pc, the better. To the best of our knowledge, our chosen data set has not yet been used in a published machine learning study. To turn it into a binary classification problem we used a threshold of pc = 0.75 = 75% to dinstinguish between SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors and inactive molecules. This threshold value which was also used in the original publication.
